# House Price Prediction Model

This project develops a house price prediction model using Linear Regression. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on various features like the number of rooms, location, and other key attributes.

# Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and duplicates to ensure data quality.
- **Preprocessing**: Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed key trends and patterns in the dataset to guide feature selection.

# Model Evaluation:
- The model's performance was evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to ensure its accuracy.

# Insights:
- Provides valuable insights into housing price trends based on critical features like location, size, and condition of the property.
